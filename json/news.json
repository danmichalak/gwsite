We've launched with the full first chapter, ready to read, though beyond that we'll update once a week on Wednesdays. I've set up the site to be able to host multiple comics, as we have some ideas for spin-offs and miniseries, and we have some friends with ideas for comics. However, those won't be coming for a while, and even then Grace's Wings will remain our flagship series. You can start reading through from the Archive button at top. We have a cast page that will be updated as the series goes on. Any questions? Feel free to contact us at the places on the Contact page. Enjoy!"
